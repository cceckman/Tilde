# syscolor: Define a Bash function to give the color in human-readable terms.
# Why function rather than a script? Keep evaluation in-process.
# Why "syscolor"? Should use for Bash, screen, and whatever else.
# Why multiple definition of the function? So that it's evaluated when the function
#  is loaded, rather than at every invocation. We can probably do better.
