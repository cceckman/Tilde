This repository hosts my versions of .*rc and various configs
for Unix-based programs.  Hopefully this will help you
configure your own system in a way that helps you.

The master branch is for OS X; there may soon be branches 
for Linux (and possibly later for Windows).

Shoutouts to rduplain for the initial .screenrc, .vimrc,
and .pythonrc.py files.
